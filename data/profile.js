He learns fast but digs deep. I haven't seen such depth of knowledge in many veterans out there. His philosophy towards work is also unique - learning new things should be prioritized over working with same concepts.\nI still cherish the days when I had a chance to work with him - as a team player, as a silent learner, as a friend. I have high hope that down the road someday we'll work together again - and i will wait for that day.\n"
